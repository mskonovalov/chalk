Maybe it's not the best topic to start the blog but as almost 6 months passed since I moved to Sydney I got some first impression about staying here and want to share it. Of course it is not the final version of my thoughts but just current vision of the situation. Will update it in future.

So let's start. 

# Property price

Property in Sydney is like a BitCoin - huge soap bubble. Everybody is waiting when it blows. And it is crazy to buy property now as the price is on the peak. This situation is not unique. It is said it is similar to California and many other "attractive" regions. A lot of reach chineese people have difficulties with transfering money from China and saving from the government. The easiest way is to buy property somewhere and lease it. And they do - they are ready to pay crazy money for almost ruined houses just because it is a good investment and the most safe. This makes situation on the market really awful when price for the house can became twice higher just in a year. That's why locals don't bother about buying their own property.

# Rent price

There are too many reach people here in Sydney who earned their money outside Australia and decided to spend it here! That should not be bad but comparing to them you feel poor especially in aspect of renting. Just a bit of numbers: our office is located in Surry Hills where you can rent starting from $600-$700 per week. If you want to live near the beach or at least have Harbour view be ready to pay $2000-$4000 per week. OMG!

# Private childcare price

Education system in Australia doesn't provide childcare for kids under 5 years old when they have to start to attend to primary school. The only option here is to visit private childcare centers . but the prices are terrible! I understand that private childcare is expensive everywhere because parents prefer to have the best service for their kids. But... my kids visited private kindergartens in Russia and that was expensive too. But totally not so expensive. E.g. back in St. Petersburg we paid 35 000 per month that corresponds to 2/3  of our montly rental price. BUt here in Sydney private childcare price starts from 120$ per day!!! That is higher than our rental price per day.

# Public transport expences

Public transport in Sydney is awful. Periodically I have to wait for 20-30 mins for the next train. Also it is very ususal situation that due to some accident all transport is postponed and you have to find alternative ways to reach youir destination. But at the same time it costs not huge but I'd say higher than normal. Usually I spend about $40 per week passing half of my way by car.

# Home internet

Internet is the worst thing in Australia. Due to Australia is an Island they have problems with connection to WWW. Due to this government organised an initiative NBN (National Broadband Network) - built magistral network and started to sell traffic to local providers that can only retail it to clients. Not only this network is a single point of failure but the problem is the speed - it is awful in peak hours (evenings especially on weekends). And of cource the price. Currently I pay $75 per month for limited (!) 500Gb internet package with 50Mbps speed wich is a bit lower generally. And if you want to have unlimited traffic with the same speed or higher it would cost you starting from $90 per month (of course you can save a bit by signing fixed contract with termination fee or buying router from your provider).

# Road fines

Just a short fact - fine for turn under the red arrow signal is $439!

# Local beer

Local beer sucks! Of course you can buy some german beer but... Strangely it's quite hard to find the most famous australian beer Fosters. So when I accidentally found it in the shop I decided I have to try it. It was the most useless waste of $16.
